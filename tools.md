## Feedback
Each and every one of us own our feedback and are responsible for gathering it latest when filling the My Impact canvas. 

There are several tools available for gathering feedback.

- Feedback letter (example letter)
- Google forms
- E-mail
- Face-to-face discussion

When gathering feedback, remember to talk to different relevant parties in 3x2 manner.

- Your (project) team members
- Account manager or client (depending on client relationship)
- Your supervisor

Make sure you have both praise type of feedback (your successes) as well as advice type of feedback (where you could improve). Remember, advice feedback is hugely valuable and important for our growth as professionals and human beings so remember to make sure you have also that type of feedback on your My Impact canvas!

## My Impact Canvas

**HOW ARE YOU DOING?**

How have the past 3-6 months been for you? Both personally and in your current professional role. Share your feelings, highlights and lowlights.

**KEY CONTRIBUTIONS**

What have been the biggest wins and accomplishments you’re happy with? What makes you feel successful? Start with activities that take most of your time. After figuring out your key contributions, write down your learnings and/or impact (if you’re aware of it) from these activities. Then validate with relevant people around you by talking to them and gathering feedback.

**SETBACKS AND KEY LEARNINGS FROM THEM**

Setbacks are a natural part of learning & growth. Think back what didn’t go quite as expected and what did you learn or what kind of feedback you received.

**PERSONAL GROWTH & STRENGTHS**

Consider what’s potentially holding you back in the way you act and what should you consider doing more of in order to grow in your own impact? Also think what are your personal strengths and things you should keep on doing. It’s important to gather feedback on how others see your growth areas & strengths. There might be things you don’t see yourself - it’s free coaching!

**PEER IMPACT**

To give credit where credit is due, share two close colleagues you have learned the most from. Also share two close colleagues you would always choose to have in your team. Feel free to write more about why you feel this way.

**SELF ASSESSMENT**

Finally, perform a self assessment whether you feel you have grown in your impact over the past 6-12 months and would recommend a raise for yourself. Feel free to add additional details.

## My Journey Canvas

**MY JOURNEY VISION**

What is your vision of a role you want to have in future. Time frame can be a two-year tour of duty or a ten year journey to become a TED talker, a known name in the community, a CEO, live a life abroad, become a startup entrepreneur. Instead of a clear role, you can also write down what you want to do more of and less of in your everyday work. Also consider how your journey contributes to your personal growth as well as company growth to help ground your vision.

**NEXT 6-12 MONTHS OF MY JOURNEY**

Specify the next step of your journey, i.e. the next 6-12 months. How is your role changing or what do you envision to be doing more of / less of.

**SMART GOALS**

Specify goals that take you towards your vision. What will you specifically do, when will you be completed (e.g. by year end) and why is this important to you. To help you in progressing your goal forward, define up front steps that tell you if you are progressing with your goal, how do you know that you have completed it and what outcome exceeds your own expectations - an outcome you don’t quite see possible today.

**SHARING FOR TRANSPARENCY**

Consider sharing your My Journey canvas with colleagues! Your journey & goals are an inspiration for others and help your colleagues support you on your journey.

## Journaling

**HOW**

In all the exercises, have a journal or a few pieces of paper and a pen. Don’t get stuck with your own thoughts, keep the pen flowing at all times. If you don’t know what to write, keep on writing “...I don’t know what to write…” and you’ll figure it out!

**CORE VALUES (for My Journey)**

Choose 3 people you admire. For each person, write what traits you admire, and in what situations they displayed these traits.

Review what you wrote.

Create a list of 5 core values that you hold.

**IDEAL FUTURE (for My Journey)**

If everything in your life would meet your most optimistic expectations, what would your life be like in 5 years.

Who are you and what are you doing?

How do you feel?

How are your relationships with others?

**PAST 3-6 MONTHS (for My Impact)**

Think back to the past 3-6 months.

Keep on writing how things have been going, how have you been doing and feeling in your life and work?
